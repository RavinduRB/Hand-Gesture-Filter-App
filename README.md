### ❄️ Key Features
- Real Time Webcam Feed - Captures and displays video using OpenCV and Tkinter.
- Hand Gesture Recognition - Detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe and counts raised fingers.
- Gesture-Controlled Filters -
  - 2 Fingers → Vector Art Filter
  - You can easily add more filters for different gestures
- Modular Filter Design - Easy to expand with more filters or gesture mappings.
- User Friendly Interface - Clean GUI made with Tkinter.
